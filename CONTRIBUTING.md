## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Linux system with XIGMATEK hardware (preferred)
- Git and GitHub account
- Python 3.8+ development environment
- Familiarity with USB/HID protocols (for advanced contributions)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # On GitHub, click "Fork" button
   git clone https://github.com/nikola-zdravkovic/xigmatek-linux-driver.git
   cd xigmatek-linux-driver
   ```

2. **Create development environment**
   ```bash
   # Install development dependencies
   pip3 install --user hidapi pytest black flake8
   
   # Install system dependencies
   sudo pacman -S python-hidapi lm_sensors  # Arch
   # or
   sudo apt install python3-hid lm-sensors  # Ubuntu/Debian
   ```

3. **Set up pre-commit hooks (optional)**
   ```bash
   pip3 install --user pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8
- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **Imports**: Group standard library, third-party, local imports
- **Comments**: Clear, concise explanations

### Code Formatting
```bash
# Format code with Black
black src/xigmatek-monitor.py

# Check style with flake8
flake8 src/xigmatek-monitor.py --max-line-length=88
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run device tests (requires hardware)
python3 scripts/test-device.py

# Test service functionality
sudo python3 src/xigmatek-monitor.py --test

# Test installation script
./setup.sh
```

## Contribution Process

### 1. Create an Issue (Optional but Recommended)
- Describe the problem or feature
- Get feedback before starting work
- Avoid duplicate efforts

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 3. Make Changes
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write clear commit messages
- Test your changes

### 4. Commit Guidelines
```bash
# Good commit messages:
git commit -m "Fix display flickering on fast updates"
git commit -m "Add support for custom temperature offsets"
git commit -m "Update documentation for Fedora installation"

# Use imperative mood ("Fix" not "Fixed" or "Fixes")
# Explain what the commit does, not what you did
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Then create PR on GitHub
```
